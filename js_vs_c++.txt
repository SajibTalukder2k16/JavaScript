C++ Vs JavaScript
1.Variable Declaration,type casting
2.object initialization
3.Object elements access(using dot,using key value) 
4.Print object(operator overloading)
5.Equality check(Strict Equal,less equal)
6.Falsy,truthy in js
7.Using let or not using let while declaring variable
8.for in loop
9.for of loop
10.Factory function
11.Object properties can be changed at the runtime(adding and deleting)
12.input,output
13.not so suitable for competitive programming
14.full stack,back end
15.interpreter, compiler
16.faster
17.can be integrated with html,css
18.Array(in js there can be different types of variable in a single array)
19.semicolon
20.sometimes it's difficult to find out the mistake(not error)

Syntax of JavaScript looks like a combination of c++ and python.
